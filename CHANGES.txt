changes : 

- why is everything commented out in fmodx, fmody, fmodz? I replaced this by x, y, z now
  -> ok it seems the neighbourhood is now implemented differently, but there is a bug 
  in 3D!

- do NOT use "i" methods anymore from outside CPM !  
  (I wish I could make these private!)
  -> instead, there are generator functions for cellpixels and cellborder pixels
