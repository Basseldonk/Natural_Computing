changes : 

- ECM is no special thing anymore. By definition, we say that cell type 0 is the background / ECM.
  This means we don't need to do anythin special with adhesion.

- STROMA is not special anymore either. We will implement this by having a special hamiltonian
  term (hard constraint) that causes all copy attempts into certain cell types to fail.

- why is everything commented out in fmodx, fmody, fmodz? I replaced this by x, y, z now

- we don't actually need both bgborderpixels and cellborderpixels!

- seeding cells etc. now done in a separate "Initializer" class


- do NOT use "i" methods anymore from outside CPM !  
  (I wish I could make these private!)
