changes : 

- ECM is no special thing anymore. By definition, we say that cell type 0 is the background / ECM.
  This means we don't need to do anything special with adhesion.

- STROMA is not special anymore either. We will implement this by having a special hamiltonian
  term (hard constraint) that causes all copy attempts into certain cell types to fail.
  (Or perhaps think about an even more efficient method where we no longer store cells 
  bordering certain types)

- why is everything commented out in fmodx, fmody, fmodz? I replaced this by x, y, z now
  -> ok it seems the neighbourhood is now implemented differently, but there is a bug 
  in 3D!

- we don't actually need both bgborderpixels and cellborderpixels!

- seeding cells etc. now done in a separate "Initializer" class


- do NOT use "i" methods anymore from outside CPM !  
  (I wish I could make these private!)
  -> instead, there are generator functions for cellpixels and cellborder pixels
