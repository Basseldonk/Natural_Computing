	* app/index.js : added Activity Constraint to the build.
	* Canvas.js : fixed code for displaying the activity model

	* hamiltonian/SoftConstraint.js ( deltaH ) : Disabled eslint error on unused variables
	for this method. 
	* hamiltonian/HardConstraint.js ( fulfilled ): Disabled eslint error on unused variables
	for this  method.
