	* file ( method in file ) : changes.
###
2019-07-04 Inge Wortel <ingewortel@gmail.com>
	* hamiltonian/BarrierConstraint.js : new hard constraint to replace
	the "stroma" celltype in the previous version. Basically, this 
	constraint sets one cellkind as "barrier" cellkind. Copy attempts
	from or into pixels with this cellkind are forbidden. Which cellkinds
	are barrier are defined in the conf object in the IS_BARRIER array,
	with a boolean value for each cellkind.
	* grid/gridInitializer.js : added functions to define a plane on
	the grid and to set all pixels in that plane to a certain cellkind.
	This can be used to build microchannels, for example.

2019-03-20 Johannes Textor <johannes.textor@gmx.de>
	* stats/PostMCSStats.js : new class for parameters that can be
	computed after each Monte Carlo steps. Includes an event listener that
	converts the CPM class's internal pixel representation to a more
	convenient format allowing direct access to cell pixels. This should
	prevent us from calling this method over and over again like in
	previous versions.
	Moreover, I have improved the centroid computation when there is a
	torus. There is now a simpler algorithm that relies on the same
	assumption and does not require us to compute connected components.
	I removed all methods that now have an implementation in this file
	from Stats.js and TODO: Stats.js should no longer exist in the future.
	* hamiltonian/PreferredDirectionConstraint : new constraint that
	implements Beltman-style direcetional persistence. Includes a
	parameter that controls the amount of angular diffusion.
	* examples/many-cells.html : new example showcasing the persistent
	direction constraint

2019-03-10 Johannes Textor <johannes.textor@gmx.de>
	* examples-node/ : changed all examples to new syntax
	* benchmarks/ : new folder with simple scripts for benchmarking the
	framework
	* CPM.js : simplified border updating code, yields ~3-4fold speedup
	for 3D simulations.

2019-03-09 Johannes Textor <johannes.textor@gmx.de>
	* examples/ : changed all examples to new syntax, added perimeter
	constraint where missing

2019-03-09 Inge Wortel <ingewortel@gmail.com>
	* hamiltonian/ActivityConstraint2.js : Added new implementation of the activity
	constraint that directly tracks activity values in an object instead of their birth
	time. This implementation should be more efficient because pixels are removed once
	their activity reaches zero.
		!!! We may want to make a test that checks if two implementations do the same
		thing?
	* app/index.js : use ActivityConstraint2.js instead of ActivityConstraint.js for
	the build.
	* examples/actmodel.html : fixed bug because of change in CPM.js file. Added a 
	perimeter constraint to the cell.

2019-03-09 Johannes Textor <johannes.textor@gmx.de>
	* hamiltonian/Constraint.js : new base class for all constraints
	* CPM.js: renamed addTerm to simply "add" -- we may want to add other
	things like loggers, trackers, drawing functions. Also fixed bug in
	cellBorderPixels
	* hamiltonian/PersistenceConstraint.js : works now

2019-03-08 Inge Wortel <ingewortel@gmail.com>
	* CPM.js : wrapped grid.neighi as an internal function here.
	* hamiltonian/ActivityConstraint.js : Added this file.
	* app/index.js : added Activity Constraint to the build.
	* Canvas.js : fixed code for displaying the activity model
	* examples/actmodel.html : added an example with act model (this doesn't work
	properly yet, as the cell needs a perimeter constraint to stay together).

2019-03-08 Johannes Textor <johannes.textor@gmx.de>
	* CPM.js : added listener stubs for pixel changes and MCS termination
	* TestLogger.js : new file for simple logging of events, to check if
	this works

2019-03-08 Inge Wortel <ingewortel@gmail.com>
	* Makefile : changed call to rollup to a direct call to the rollup binary in 
	node_modules, so it doesn't require a global install.
	* hamiltonian/SoftConstraint.js : fixed typo in filename. 
	* hamiltonian/SoftConstraint.js ( deltaH ) : Disabled eslint error on unused variables
	for this method. 
	* hamiltonian/HardConstraint.js ( fulfilled ): Disabled eslint error on unused variables
	for this  method.
