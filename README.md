# How it works

This code has been ported over from our older "cpm" repository. This is now an ES6 module, which is compiled trough "rollup" for use in the browser. See the Makefile.

## Browser examples

We have the following examples for web-browser CPMs:

* [A simple Ising model](examples/basic-potts-model.html)

## Node examples

TBD
