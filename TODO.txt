- (Inge): implement checks for valid sim configuration files.

- (Inge): current centroid method probably won't work for microchannels, as cells occupy more than 50% of the grid height for a microchannel. The torus correction will go wrong in that case even though there actually shouldn't be a torus correction in the y dimension.

- Implement Laplacian / Gradient for 3D lattice

- Finish implementation of chemotaxis constraint

- Should it be possible to call stats not every timestep, but at defined or entirely custom intervals?
