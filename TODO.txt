- (Inge): check confCheckers and ChemotaxisConstraint
Fix the many-cells-diffusion example.

- (Inge): implement checks for valid sim configuration files.

- (Inge): current centroid method probably won't work for microchannels, as cells occupy more than 50% of the grid height for a microchannel. The torus correction will go wrong in that case even though there actually shouldn't be a torus correction in the y dimension.

- Implement Laplacian / Gradient for 3D lattice

- Finish implementation of chemotaxis constraint

- Do we need to make it possible to compute stats for individual cells instead
  of for all cells at once?
